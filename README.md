# Agent-based model of online social media and social networks

An agent-based model (ABM) of attitude dynamics applied to national identity in the case of Catalonia (Spain). This model includes online social media (filter bubbles) and social networks (weighted multilayer multiplex) to understand how national identities can become polarised. \
This research was carried out at Glasgow University as part of my PhD project. The previous version of the published paper was awared the best PhD student paper award at the Social Simulation Conferences (SSC) 2022 in Milan, following its plenary session.

This repository contains the Netlogo code, experimental design and data analyses for the model outputs, also in OSF/fraq, supporting the paper Chueca Del Cerro, C. (2024) The power of social networks and social media’s filter bubble in shaping polarisation: an
